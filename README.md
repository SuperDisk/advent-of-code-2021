# Advent of Code 2021

Here it is. I'm using this as an excuse to learn Tcl, which has always facinated me, but never enough to convince me to sit down and learn it. It blurs the line between the "elegant, beautiful, spiritual, meditate-about-it-on-your-ayahuasca-retreat" Lisp snobbery, and an almost joke language-- there is only one data structure: the string.

All solutions are in Tcl, dumped haphazardly into the repo, and are most likely extremely ugly.
